# Isomorphic-arrays

```javascript
any == [any]
```

## Philosophy

Every Single object or primitive type is equivalent to an array of one item. Therefore, every methods of `Array` can be apply to anything.
I thinks of this philosophy has no bad effect to the current Javascript.
I knows this is wacky, but i curious of what do you thinks ?
